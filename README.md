# Ledger.Net
Cross Platform C# Library For Ledger Hardwarewallet

Currently supports:
* Android
* Windows
* UWP (Except the UWP Package Manifest has a bug that won't allow the Ledger Vendor Id)

## Quick Start

- Connect Ledger and enter pin
- Open Bitcoin app
- Clone the repo and run the GetAddress unit test
- Repeat for Ethereum

**Would love to see some samples for UWP or Android**

## Store App Production Usage (Not Yet In Production)

This app currently only Supports Trezor (https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Trezor.Net) but it will soon support Ledger with this library.
